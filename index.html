                        <p class="div_p">Women have the right to abortion. They should be have the </br> right to whether or not to keep the baby. If they want to keep </br> the baby they can. But, if they don't they have all rights to </br> not keep it. They shoudln't have to worry about people putting </br> their hands on their body or anything. This is why Abortion </br> should be legal. Women should be worried about to wear for a </br> date, whether they should go out with a guy or another lady,
                        </br> or what shoes to buy. They shouldn't have to worry about </br> people telling them what they can and can't do with their bodies. </br> When is it okay to have an Abortion? When it's to save a </br> mothers life? Does the U.S. allow it when it's to save a life. </br> This isn't known and people are scared to find out. So this is </br> why people go to different countries that have abortion legal. </br> People have to spend more money just to have it to where they </br> can save the mother's life. Women should be able to have an </br> abortion in the U.S. in case of emergency. If we overturn Roe v</p>
                        <p class="div_p2">Wade, we could endanger lives. If someone were to do an abortion with an unskilled practitioner. They have a chance of being injured and even </br> killed. But with the right measures. Especially, a skilled practitioner, you would be safe to get an abortion. Women and girls get an illegal </br> abortion in secret because they are less likely to seek help. These result in people being sent to the hospital afterwords. This is due to them being </br> stubborn to not go seek help, the doctors they hire in secret don't have the resources to really do the procedure. This is why people are injured </br> and die to to illegal abortions. Abortions are higher in places where its illegal because telling someone something that they can't do with </br> themselves will want them to do it more. The U.S. has one of the highest Abortion rates in the world because people do it more and more because </br> they are told that they can't. Places in Europe have it legalized and they have one of the lowest Abortion rates because it's legal. People will most </br> likely do what they are told what they can't do. The U.S. would have lower abortion rates if it allowed access to modern contraceptives. On top of </br> it if adolescents are informed about reproduction, sexuality education, and contraception. They also would have fewer abortions if they were to </br> allow safe and legal abortions. Also, if they where to make it so that people can receive care for post-abortion complications. Just waiving some </br> restrictions the Roe v Wade law has would make people not have illegal abortions as much.</p>

                        <p class="div_p">Abortion Laws have gone back to the 19th Century. These </br> laws have been around for ages. However, they keep getting </br> stricter. They say that you can't get an abortion once quickening </br> starts. That is when the baby starts to kick. It starts between 14 </br> to 26 week into the pregnancy. It didn't become illegal to get an </br> abortion before quickening until after 1860. This is because they </br> can see it as murder. However, they can't enforce this and restrict </br> people from getting an abortion if it affects their religion. This </br> is because you the federal and state governments can't restrict </br> your freedom of religion. Which indicates that you have the </br> right to any religiion you want. So, if your religion starts that </br> you can't have a child until you are married. If you end up </br> getting pregnant before. Then you have to get an abortion if </br> your religion states. So, your 1st amendment is protected </br> by your right to freedom of reglion. This is important because </br> you are safe from the governments laws and restrictions that</p>
                        <p class="div_p2">they make. The government also can't make a religion that everyone has to follow. Since it would be against the 1st amendment. So, this is why </br> people have the right to express their religion freely. Women are now able to get abortions at home. There are these pills that women can take. </br> These pills make it to where anyone can get an abortion. However, congress is overturning an executive order and banning these pills. These pills </br> have been banned and are pending in Indiana, Montana, Arizona, Arkansas, Alabama, Iowa just this year alone. Women and girls have to go far </br> beyond the limitations that they have to because of this law. There are populations and communities that are greatly affected by laws. The Roe v </br> Wade law is one more of those laws that these communities have to live with. These communites are but not limited to immigrants, adolescents, </br> lesbians, and bisexual cisgender women and girls. These women shouldn't have to live with the amount of restrictions that they face. They have </br> already gone through a lot of challenges in their lives. What if these women get jumped and are raped, and they get pregnant from this. If this </br> happens, is it okay for women to get an Abortion? What are the limitations and how far this is law go? The government needs to either waive the </br> Roe v Wade law or explain what is and isn't okay for an abortion in the law. But, women don't deserve this and it's not fair to them. They deserve </br> better than this. They have worked hard to prove themselves and get to where they are today. Make exceptions for them. That much our </br> country should give them.</p>
