                        <p class="div_p">Women have the right to abortion. They should be have the </br> right to whether or not to keep the baby. If they want to keep </br> the baby they can. But, if they don't they have all rights to </br> not keep it. They shoudln't have to worry about people putting </br> their hands on their body or anything. This is why Abortion </br> should be legal. Women should be worried about to wear for a </br> date, whether they should go out with a guy or another lady,
                        </br> or what shoes to buy. They shouldn't have to worry about </br> people telling them what they can and can't do with their bodies. </br> When is it okay to have an Abortion? When it's to save a </br> mothers life? Does the U.S. allow it when it's to save a life. </br> This isn't known and people are scared to find out. So this is </br> why people go to different countries that have abortion legal. </br> People have to spend more money just to have it to where they </br> can save the mother's life. Women should be able to have an </br> abortion in the U.S. in case of emergency.</p>

                        <p class="div_p">Abortion Laws have gone back to the 19th Century. These </br> laws have been around for ages. However, they keep getting </br> stricter. They say that you can't get an abortion once quickening </br> starts. That is when the baby starts to kick. It starts between 14 </br> to 26 week into the pregnancy. It didn't become illegal to get an </br> abortion before quickening until after 1860. This is because they </br> can see it as murder. However, they can't enforce this and restrict </br> people from getting an abortion if it affects their religion. This </br> is because you the federal and state governments can't restrict </br> your freedom of religion. Which indicates that you have the </br> right to any religiion you want. So, if your religion starts that </br> you can't have a child until you are married. If you end up </br> getting pregnant before. Then you have to get an abortion if </br> your religion states. So, your 1st amendment is protected </br> by your right to freedom of reglion. This is important because </br> you are safe from the governments laws and restrictions that</p>
                        <p class="div_p2">they make. The government also can't make a religion that everyone has to follow. Since it would be against the 1st amendment. So, this is why </br> people have the right to express their religion freely. Women are now able to get abortions at home. There are these pills that women can take. </br> These pills make it to where anyone can get an abortion. However, congress is overturning an executive order and banning these pills. These pills </br> have been banned and are pending in Indiana, Montana, Arizona, Arkansas, Alabama, Iowa just this year alone.</p>
