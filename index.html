                        <p>Abortion Laws have gone back to the 19th Century. These laws have been around for ages. However, they keep getting stricter. They say that you can get an abortion once quickening starts. That when the baby starts to kick. It starts between 14 to 26 week into the pregnancy. It didn't become illegal to get an abortion before quickening until after 1860.</p>
